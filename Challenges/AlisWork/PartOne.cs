  /// Challenge 1/2: The Prototype
  /// Mylara, the captain of the Guard of Consolas, has approached you with the beginnings of a plan to hunt down the Uncoded One's airship. "If we're going to be able to track this thing down," she says, "we need you to make us a program that can help us home in on a location." She lays out a plan for a program to help with the hunt. One user representing the pilot of the airship picks a number between zero and 100. Another user, the Hunter, will then attempt to guess the number. The program will tell the hunter that they guess correctly or that the number was too high or too low. The program repeats until the hunter guesses the number correctly. Mylar claims "If we can build this program, we can use what we learn to build a better version to hunt down the Uncoded One's airship".

Only by combining Mylara's prototype, Skorin's cannon, and your programming skills will you have the chance to win this fight. You must build a program that allows one user--the pilot of the *Manticore*--to enter the airship's range from the city and a second user--the city's defenses--to attempt to find what distance the airship is at and destroy it before it can lay waste to the town.
  /// 
  /// The first user begins by secretly establishing how far the *Manticore* is from the city, in the range 0 to 100. The program then allows a second player to repeatedly attempt to destroy the airship by picking the range to target until either the city of Consolas or the Manticore is destroyed. In each attempt, the player is told if they overshot (too far), fell short (not far enough), or hit the *Manticore*. The damage dealt to the *Manticore* depends on the turn number. For most turns, 1point of damage is dealt, but if the turn number is a multiple of 3, a fire blast deals 3 points of damage; a multiple of 5, an electric blast deals 3 points of damage, and if it is a multiple of both 3 and 5, a mighty fire-electric blast steals 10 points of damage. The *Manticore* has 10 points of damage it can take and is destroyed after being dealt 10 points of damage.
  /// However, if the *Manticore* survives a turn, it will deal a guaranteed 1 point of damage to the city of Consolas. The city can only take 15 points of damage before being annihilated.
