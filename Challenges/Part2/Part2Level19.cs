  /// Challenge 1/1: Vin's Trouble 
  ///<br/> "Master Programmer!" Vin Fletcher shouts at you as he races to catch up to you. "I have a problem. I created an arrow for a young man who took it and changed its length to be half as long as I had built it to be. It no longer fit in his bow correctly and misfired. It sliced his hand pretty bad. He'll survive, but is there any way we can make sure somebody doesn't change an arrow's length when they walk away from my shop? I don't want to be the cause of such self-inflicted pain." With your knowledge of information hiding, you know you can help.
  ///<br/> 
  ///<br/> **Objectives:** 
  ///<br/> [] Modify your `Arrow` class to have `private` instead of `public` instance variables. 
  ///<br/> [] Add in getter methods for each of the instance variables that you have.
