# TODO NOTES
- [ ] Create Part classes
- [ ] Refactor level classes (interface, more shared methods)
- [ ] Add level partner-classes that: store examples, house syntax examples, hold experiments: Example, Snippets, Experiments
- [ ] For code notes: 
    1. Copy snippets to README (include numbering like 1/3 and ##### headings) 
    2. Add snippets to level's companion class and make sure each runs (use inner classes if needed, can change to simpler type later on if it makes sense)
    3. Create an inner Example class that demonstrates everything from snippets. Add 'Proof of concept' footer sections where applicable. Keep additional notes in the readme.
    4. Create an inner Experiments class and add questions to experiment with as you go. Test them out here.
