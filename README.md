# AliMiraKim's Notes: The C# Player's Guide (4th Edition)

## Instructions:
1. `cd` into `Challenges/` folder.
2. Run `dotnet run` on command line.
3. You should see the titles of each challenge. Each level has its own class with methods for every challenge or knowledge check.
4. Fill out the empty methods to fulfill each challenge's objectives and run `dotnet run` to see the results.
5. To hide levels/challenges you don't need to see anymore: Comment out levels inside `Challenges/Program.cs` or comment out challenges/knowledge check method calls inside the level's `CallAll` method.
